    <h3>Scenario 1: What if a customer falls off the raft and gets injured during the trip?</h3>
    <p>Answer: In the unlikely event that a customer falls off the raft and gets injured, 
      we have trained guides who will immediately provide first aid and call for emergency medical assistance if needed. 
      We also have liability insurance to cover any medical expenses or legal issues that may arise.
    <h3>Scenario 2: What if the weather conditions suddenly turn bad during the trip?</h3>
    <p>Answer: Our water rafting company closely monitors the weather conditions before and during the trip. 
      If the weather suddenly turns bad, our guides will take necessary safety 
      measures such as stopping the raft and waiting until it is safe to continue. 
      In case of extreme weather conditions, we may cancel or reschedule the trip for the safety of our customers.</p>
    <h3>Scenario 3: What if a customer cancels the reservation at the last minute?</h3>
    <p>Answer: We understand that sometimes unexpected situations arise, 
      and customers may need to cancel their reservation. In such cases, we have a cancellation policy in place. 
      If the cancellation is made within 48 hours of the trip, a fee may be charged. 
      However, if the cancellation is made prior to 48 hours, we offer a full refund. 
      We encourage our customers to communicate with us as soon as possible in 
      case of any cancellations or changes in their reservations.</p>
